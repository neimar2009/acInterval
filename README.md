Help me
------------
  Due to the limited time available for development, I present this project in the
  way that you see it. Personally, I'm sorry, but so far I've been able to develop.
  
  My English is weak, to the extent possible, depending on available time, I will
  translate.
  
  Comments and suggestions will help in improving the project. Welcome.


Thanks
